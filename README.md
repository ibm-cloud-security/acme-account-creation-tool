# acme-account-creation-tool

Utility to create or retrieve an account with certificate authorities that support the [Automatic Certificate Management Environment (ACME)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555) protocol. 

If you're working with [IBM CloudÂ® Secrets Manager](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/secrets-manager), you can use this tool to enable your instance to order public TLS certificates from Let's Encrypt. To learn more about ordering and managing certificates with Secrets Manager, check out the [IBM Cloud documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-prepare-order-certificates). 

## Usage
1. Download a binary for your Operating System [from available Releases](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-security/acme-account-creation-tool/releases).
2. Review the following usage guidelines.

```
Usage of ./acme-account-creation-tool:
-o, --outputFilenamePrefix   file name prefix to store the account details  

[-e], [--email]  email to be registered for the account  

[-d], [--directoryURL]  acme directory URL of the CA. Following alias are defined: "letsencrypt-prod", "letsencrypt-stage"  (default letsencrypt-prod) 

[-g], [--keyTypeToGenerate]  key type to generate. Supported values - rsa2048, rsa3072, rsa4096, ec256, ec384 (default ec256) 

[-k], [--privateKeyPath]  path to the private key in PKCS1/PKCS8 PEM format to be used. If an account with this private key exists, the account will be retrieved. This flag overrides the -g flag  
```

A successful request registers a new account and stores the account credentials in `<outputFilenamePrefix>-private-key.pem`. Your account information is stored in  `<outputFilenamePrefix>-account-info.json`.

#### Notes

- Email address is optional, but recommended so that Let's Encrypt can send expiry notices when your certificates are coming up for renewal.
- You can choose to provide your own private key in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 format. If a key isn't provided, the tool generates one automatically on your behalf. To specify the key type, use the `-g, --keyTypeToGenerate` flag.
- Use the private key that is generated for your new ACME account to [add a certificate authority configuration](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-add-certificate-authority) in Secrets Manager.

### Supported certificate authorities

#### [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)

Create an account that targets the Let's Encrypt production environment.
```
./acme-account-creation-tool -e <email> -o my-letsencrypt -d letsencrypt-prod
```

Create an account that targets the Let's Encrypt staging environment.
```
./acme-account-creation-tool -e <email> -o my-letsencrypt -d letsencrypt-stage
```
